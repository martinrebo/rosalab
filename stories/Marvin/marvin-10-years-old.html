        <h1 id="Marvin-10-years-old"><a href="#Marvin-10-years-old" class="headerlink" title="Marvin 10 years old"></a>Marvin 10 years old</h1><p>Marvin was only ten when he encountered yet another nightmare in the form of his new teacher, Ms. Delgado. Compared to her, even the dreaded Mr. Roldán seemed almost tame. Ms. Delgado’s method of control wasn’t as direct—she rarely raised a hand against the students—yet everyone knew she took pride in making children feel small, worthless, and afraid. Her words cut deeper than any ruler or clenched fist.  </p>
<p>Under her piercing stare, Marvin felt exposed. A single mistake—a wrong answer, a missed homework assignment, or a crooked shirt collar—triggered her sneers. She seemed to relish mocking the students in front of the class, coming up with stinging nicknames and reminding them, in her chillingly soft voice, that they should consider themselves lucky she was only using words.  </p>
<p>But Ms. Delgado wasn’t the only terror in Marvin’s world. By now, his elementary school shared its recess yard with older kids—some as old as sixteen. They lumbered around in oversized uniforms or battered jackets, cigarettes dangling from their lips as they made their rounds. Teenage bravado gave them an air of invincibility, and they knew it. They would blow smoke in younger students’ faces, snatch lunch money, and push kids aside when they walked by.  </p>
<p>Marvin had also just started wearing prescription glasses; his blurred vision meant constant headaches otherwise. The first day he wore them, a group of these older teens cornered him behind the gym. They flicked at the frames, called him “Four-Eyes,” and laughed when he tried to push them away. It became a daily cat-and-mouse chase, with Marvin dodging them the moment he spotted their looming figures on the playground.  </p>
<p>Life got even more complicated over the next couple of years. Marvin tried to survive the school days by hiding in the library or hanging out near the faculty lounge—anywhere he thought the bullies might not bother to look. Yet the pressure of teenage culture still found him. By thirteen, Marvin had already tested the limits of curiosity and peer pressure. He nervously took drags off stolen cigarettes, coughed at the taste of cheap beer, and even swigged some unidentified liquor he assumed was rum, all in an attempt to fit in—or at least be left alone.  </p>
<p>That was also the year Marvin fell in love for the first time, with a classmate who shared her stories and jokes with him during lunch. She was his small ray of sunshine, an anchor he clung to as the chaos of school threatened to swallow him whole. But heartbreak came early: she left him for an older boy—one of the same teens Marvin had always dreaded. Seeing her walk away with that smug sixteen-year-old ripped a new kind of wound through him—an ache that no schoolyard beating or cruel teacher’s insult had ever prepared him for.  </p>
<p>All this happened before his fourteenth birthday, and before he even entered high school. Yet the cycle of abuse, fear, and disappointment already felt deeply familiar. Marvin trudged through the hallways each day, glasses slipping down his nose, shoulders hunched, bracing for the next sneer or shove—unsure if the world outside would ever be kinder.  </p>
